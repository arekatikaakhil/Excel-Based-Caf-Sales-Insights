## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation

The original dataset included missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues. The following steps were taken to clean and standardize the data:

- **Item Names:** Cleaned using `TRIM` and `PROPER`, invalid or missing values marked as "Missing".
- **Quantity & Price Per Unit:** Standardized and validated for consistency.
- **Total Spent:** Recalculated using formulas to validate correctness (`Cleaned Quantity * Cleaned Price`).
- **Payment Method & Location:** Cleaned using conditional formulas, unknowns standardized as "Missing".
- **Dates:** Parsed into `Month` and `Weekday` for better time-series analysis.
- **Review Flags:** Added logical validation columns to flag inconsistencies in Total Spent or data quality.
